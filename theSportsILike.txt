I really enjoy participating in sports

Sports:
1)Volley Ball
2)Netball
Exercise Source Control:
PS.: Make sure to write the answers in between the pseudocode that follow
You are required to give the following statements in the form of a command.
The default path is C:\Users\Students>
Another PS.: Make sure to name all files and folders using Camel Case without a space in between.
NB: Keep in mind to always record your answers below each question; I will mark this exercise
1.  Navigate, using the cmd, to the Documents and make a folder called, funSports.

cd Documents
mkdir funSports
cd funSports

2.  Create a text file called, theSportsILike, inside of the folder
    funSports with the following content:
    "I really enjoy participating in sports".

echo I really enjoy participating in sports> theSportsILike.txt

3.  Now go to Git Hub and create a new repository for a remote repository.
    (No command needed)

4.  Initialise your funSports folder to become a git repository.

git init 

5.  Now link the local repository to the remote repository.

git remote add  origin https://github.com/ntandomabuto/funSports.git 

6.  Now TRACK your file. After tracking, STAGE your file with a comment/message about what
    you are doing with the file.

git add theSportsILike.txt 
git commit -m "linking the file to github"

7.  Push your code to GitHub

git push 

8.  Now create a secondBranch and a thirdBranch. Change to the secondBranch.

git checkout -b secondBranch 
git checkout -b thirdBranch 
git checkout secondBranch 
git push --set-upstream origin secondBranch 

9.  Modify your text file and add the following menu to it,
    "Sports:
    1) Volley Ball
    2) Netball
    "

code . 
(then add)

10. Now what command do I use to check what has been changed between branches?
    Only if you were successful, press "q" to "bring the command line path back"

git log -p 

11. Now track and use a command to view the changes again(Hint: like you did in No. 9)
    provide your answer here

git log 

12. Stage your changes. After, push the code to Git Hub.
*****DO NOT USE GIT MERGE

git add .
git commit -m "second commit" 
git push (error...)
git pull

13. Now change to the thirdBranch.
14. Now add new Sport to the Sports in the text file,
    3) Baseball
    4) Soccer
15. Now TRACK, provide a message and PUSH the files to the thirdBranch that was created.
14. Now use a command that will bring the code from the secondBranch to the third branch.
****TRY NOT TO USE GIT MERGE
15. Now merge the thirdBranch with the main branch.
16. Now create a text file called "rules" with a text of "Everyone must play fair".
17. Stage, provide a message, and push the change to Git Hub.
18. What command would I use to check the DIFFERENCE between 2 BRANCHES.
19. Now display the full history/journal of your repository.
20. Please display the reversed order of your git repository and Make sure to explain git rebase, git fetch, git merge, and git pull.
